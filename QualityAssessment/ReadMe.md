## Task #4 
### (Image Quality Analysis â€“ is based on materials of the lecture/lab on 06.10)

1. Collect the dataset of 20 color images from open sources. It can be various  images of people/pets/nature/city etc.
2. Sort these images in the descending order according to your personal opinion about its perceptual quality https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality. For example, mark them from 5 to 1, where 5=excellent quality, 1=poor quality. Plot the marks as a captions for the images in the Notebook.
3.  Evaluate No-Reference image quality metrics TV, BRISQUE and NIMA estimating their quality (use, for example, implementations from https://github.com/photosynthesis-team/piq, https://github.com/aigagror/ML-Aesthetics-NIMA).
4. Compute Pearson correlation coefficients between the metric scores and your personal estimates.
5. Choose the best metric, which is more correlated with the human opinion.
6. Complete a task in a single Jupyter Notebook.
