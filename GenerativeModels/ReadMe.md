## Task #3

### Following the examples in the notebook which we have slightly modified on the practical class - www.kaggle.com/code/averkij/variational-autoencoder-and-faces-generation :

1.	Train Variational Autoencoder (VAE) model on “Labelled Faces in the Wild (LFW) Dataset” http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/. 
- Try to develop more complex model by adding more layers to baseline or train convolutional model – it will improve the quality of your results.
2.	Develop a function for “shaving” and “smiling” the face of a man on the input picture: 
- input – should be the image with a man with a beard and/or mustache without a smile, output – should be the image with the same man but already shaved and smiling.
3.	Check your function on a custom image of a beard man.
4.	Complete a task in a single Jupyter Notebook.
