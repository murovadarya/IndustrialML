### Task #2
1. Select the dataset and the ML problem (it is possible to select your old tasks from ML course or other courses implying ML/DL models).
2. Train the model.
3. Analyze the feature importance in your data for making predictions by your model using eli5/SHAP/LIME frameworks: 
- https://eli5.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#installation
- https://github.com/slundberg/shap
- https://github.com/marcotcr/lime

Calculate permutation importance, SHAP values (for a specific prediction, for data sampling), analyze predictions with LIME; plot PDPs and other visualizations you like.

4. Analyze all the graphs/tables and write conclusions about your data, model and features.
5. Complete a task in a single Jupyter Notebook.
